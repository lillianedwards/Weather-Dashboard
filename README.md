# Weather-Dashboard 

## Description 

With the weather changing rapidly around the world, travelers need to be able to see the weather conditions for any given city they are in or are traveling to.

Some of the features our weather app include are:

🌤️ A display card for the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity in the city searched by the user.

🌤️ Display cards for the five-day forecast, also displaying temperature, wind speed, and humidity, in the city searched by the user. 

🌤️ A dropdown menu in the nav bar that displays prior city searches by the user, saved in local storage. 

🌤️ The ability for the user to delete individual cities from the prior search dropdown menu. 

🌤️ An immediate display of the weather in the user's current location.
